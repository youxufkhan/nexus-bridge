## 🛑 The Problem: The Chaos of Scale
As e-commerce businesses grow, managing multiple brands or clients manually becomes a bottleneck:

*   **🔐 Fragmentation**: Teams are forced to cycle through dozens of seller portals just to monitor order health.
*   **📊 Spreadsheet Fragility**: Manual data entry into Google Sheets leads to catastrophic errors, lost shipping addresses, and delayed fulfillment.
*   **⚠️ The Overselling Trap**: Without real-time synchronization, inventory lag results in cancelled orders and damaged marketplace reputation.
*   **🐢 Operational Latency**: The "time-to-warehouse" for new orders is often measured in hours rather than seconds.
