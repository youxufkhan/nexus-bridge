# NexusBridge Knowledge Wiki

Welcome to the operational guide for NexusBridge. Use this wiki to understand the core workflows of the platform.

## 🚀 Onboarding & Setup

### 1. Provisioning a SaaS Tenant
As a **Superadmin**, navigate to `System Admin` in the sidebar. Enter the legal business name of the agency to create a new isolated tenant node.

### 2. Initializing Portfolios
Agencies work with diverse clients. Go to `Agency Hub > Portfolios` to register a new client entity. Each portfolio acts as a container for marketplace connections and unique product catalogs.

## 🔗 Integrated Commerce

### 3. Marketplace Connectivity
To start ingesting data:
1. Navigate to `Agency Hub > Connectivity`.
2. Select **New Configuration**.
3. Map a **Portfolio** to a **Marketplace** (Walmart, Amazon, TikTok).
4. Provide the vaulted credentials. The system will establish a "Bridge" status.

### 4. Catalog Management
View all synchronized SKU data in the `Catalog` section. Products are automatically classified by their Owner Repository (Portfolio) and system SKU node.

## 👤 Identity & Preferences

### 5. Managing Your Team
Agency Admins can invite members via the `Team Members` section. Assign roles (Administrator vs Standard Agent) to control access to integration configurations and portfolio management.

### 6. Personalizing the UI
NexusBridge supports high-contrast **Daylight** and low-light **Midnight** modes. Toggle these in your `Account Settings > Theme Preferences`.
